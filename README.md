# RDDL

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/J-F-Liu/rddl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/J-F-Liu/rddl)

Refined Data Description Language (RDDL) is based on [OpenDDL](http://openddl.org/), mainly replacing primitive data type names and literal syntax with the same in Rust.

RDDL is suitable for describing database schemas, RPC protocols, 3D models, game objects and neural networks etc.
